🚀 Existing Teen/Youth Job Platforms

There are sites that help young people find jobs or gigs, but they’re generally job boards or gig marketplaces, not rich talent showcasers:

TeenWorkHub — connects teens (14–17) with local and remote gigs and builds skill tracking, parental controls, and legal compliance into the platform.

Teen Talent — a job board specifically for teenage talent to find opportunities and for companies to post jobs aimed at teens.

Youth jobs boards — such as YouthjobsCanada or Canada Youth Works focus on youth employment and connecting youth to employers, but they’re broader and not exclusively teen‑talent focused.

General career platforms like WayUp exist for college students or recent grads, but they aren’t teen‑specific.

So yes — there are platforms where teens can find jobs, but most of them are job listing sites, not talent discovery systems that help recruiters find teens based on skills, portfolios, or badges.
