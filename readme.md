🚀 Existing Teen/Youth Job Platforms

There are sites that help young people find jobs or gigs, but they’re generally job boards or gig marketplaces, not rich talent showcasers:

TeenWorkHub — connects teens (14–17) with local and remote gigs and builds skill tracking, parental controls, and legal compliance into the platform.

Teen Talent — a job board specifically for teenage talent to find opportunities and for companies to post jobs aimed at teens.

Youth jobs boards — such as YouthjobsCanada or Canada Youth Works focus on youth employment and connecting youth to employers, but they’re broader and not exclusively teen‑talent focused.

General career platforms like WayUp exist for college students or recent grads, but they aren’t teen‑specific.

So yes — there are platforms where teens can find jobs, but most of them are job listing sites, not talent discovery systems that help recruiters find teens based on skills, portfolios, or badges.

solution it showcases like linkdin in the terms but instead has options to showcase thier volunteer and effort and thier availaiblaity for a volunteer or a job and use this a wya to fix problems of teen getting employment


What They Can Do

Create and edit their profile: Name, skills, volunteer/work experience, certificates/badges.

Update availability: Days/times they can work or volunteer.

Add new achievements: Certificates, project completions, badges.

Showcase volunteering efforts: Highlights initiative, responsibility, and commitment.

2. How It Helps

Flexibility: Teens’ schedules change as school/work balance shifts—updating availability keeps recruiters informed.

Dynamic profiles: Recruiters always see current skills and commitment, not outdated info.

Bias reduction: Shows real data on availability and effort, not assumptions about age.

Motivation: Teens are incentivized to earn badges or complete activities to improve visibility.

3. Implementation Tips for Hackathon MVP

Profile forms: Simple form for creating/editing info.

Availability: Use a dropdown or calendar-style input (e.g., “Available: Mon 3–6 PM, Sat 10–2 PM”).

Update flow: Save to local database or JSON file for MVP.

Badges & certificates: Display on profile; can be earned via mini-projects or verified volunteering.





features:
not just volenteering int this spot for these many years but how much time exactly u spent might be better as it explores further i think and show how reliable the person actually is.
instead of linkind showing he has beein in this for 2 year 

secondly it also shows how the person has the remarks by his supervisor and link it directly to his my impact (which is for generally to add hours in ymca and calgary public library and planet youth) 

it shows also the projects that the teen has worked on and his actual skill and time he has worked on it for

instaed of linkdin just asking for prem to people without jobs its just powered by tiny adds everyone respected the same instead of like linkdin yk which is annoying.

And also prev any jobs go throught this platform will be registered and also internships and showcase clearly

Schedule being a huge issue for teenagers like me as the problem hassle for both studnets and also employers of keep on even after calling for intereview finally relize different time expectations instead students could put thier free times and also only recuriters or students only could enter with thier legal verfication not just some predator or anything and safe

being busy in schools and other uni and other stuff the ability to put time and employers depending on that saves time fore both

This also useful to employers who wanted to recruit after the canadian government plan to expand the growth of teenagers in employement by providing external funds for hiring with valid expericne instead of random.
